# Case1
`
model User{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  name String?
  email String @unique
  posts Post[]
  comments Comment[]
}

model Comment{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  title String
  userId String?
  user User? @relation(fields: [userId],references: [id])
}

if we make foreign key as optional then their relation should also be optional
If userId is optional, Prisma needs to allow for cases where the relation does not exist. However, Prisma requires all relation fields (fields in the @relation directive) to be present for the relation to function properly. This mismatch causes the error.

`

# Case 2
`
model User{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  name String?
  email String @unique
  posts Post[]
  comments Comment[]?
}

model Comment{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  title String
  userId String?
  user User? @relation(fields: [userId],references: [id])
}


In Prisma, optional lists (e.g., comments Comment[]?) are not supported because lists in Prisma inherently act like an empty array ([]) when no items are present. Allowing null for a list would conflict with this design.

# Case 3

`
model User{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  name String?
  email String @unique
  posts Post[]
  comments Comment?
}

model Comment{
  id String @id @default(uuid())
  title String
  userId String?  @unique
  user User? @relation(fields: [userId],references: [id])
}

will get error reolve it by adding  @unique
Prisma interprets comment Comment? as a one-to-one relationship.
For a one-to-one relationship, the foreign key (userId in the Comment model) must be unique to ensure only one Comment can be related to a User.
